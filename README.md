# Team Avalanche's Website

This website was created by Abe Z Riggs IV using React.js

## Purpose

This website is being used as part of a project for our highschool senior and UW english class, where we are coming up with a game idea with various planes throughout history.
In the end, we need some sort of website or way to reach our audience, and the goal of this site is to make something nicer and more realistic than a simple Google Sites for 
our "game company."

I wanted experience with react, and I thought a simple website where we only really needed text and pictures would be a great introduction, so I decided to try to work on this
even if it isn't what we end up using for the final product.
